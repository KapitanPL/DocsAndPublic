# Welcome

Hi! 

I am a developper, father, dreamer... I am a Paper Fleet Captain and I welcome you on my github-pages dedicated to simple presentation of my hobby products.

I started writing few apps for my personal usage. To use them and to learn some new tools. But once in the process I decided it might be nice to share the results with others. Maybe someone else is also searching for apps like this.

## Business plan

I intentend to try to get together teams of volunteers. Like you! I have a fulltime job, a familly, and barely no time. And I guess some of you are in similar situation. 

Well, this is the chance. For me, for you. Lets try to get the products to earn money, to pay for themselves... and to pay to us. People who will work on them.

This is my promise to you, if the app you will work on becomes profitable, we will try to split the profit according to work done on the project. (We will try to assess that.)
