*DataTracker* was designed to be a simple tool to log progress. Any kind of progress. My original intention was to keep track of my weight. To get fit.

But you can track hours of sleep, cigarettes smoken, calories, distance run ... anything that is to be converted to a number. Even daily happiness.

The purpose of *DataTracker* is to allow you to see progress, to be able to see what helps and what does not in getting to your goals. The visualization should help you understand that few ups-and-downs are natural. And long-term progress is what matters most.
